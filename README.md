# Command Line Tic-Tac-Toe
To begin, clone this repo to your computer.

Navigate to the newly created directory and enter the following command:
```bash
node interface.js
```
The game begins with Player "X"

You enter moves by first specifying a row and then specifying a column.

Work in progress:
- Need to add cases when there are no available spaces (i.e. a draw occurs)
- Need to add unit testing suite
